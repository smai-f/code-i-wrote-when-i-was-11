<br><br> These "quizzes" as I like to call them, are little polls and stuff that I take, and then it tells me what you "are". Hehe, they are very fun, and very addicting. They are very hard to find, only a few websites have them now, but hopefully they will get more popular!

No one ever knows what you're going to do next. The greatest mystery to you is, naturally, "how <i>do</i> they get the caramel in the Caramilk bars?" </center>

You’re Mandy Moore!  You’re very sweet and caring.  You’re also kind of modest, and shy too.  You’re not exactly at the top, but you’re not at the bottom either.  Which is alright with you, because you’re not taking life’s gifts for granted.  Aw, you’re just the perfect little
girl!  Polite, gentle, trusting, and have this sickeningly sweet aura that just makes you so darn lovable.  But best beware, for your trusting nature can lead to pain as well.<br>
